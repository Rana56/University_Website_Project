# University_Website_Project
This website was created for a university project. The aim of the project was to display events on the website, allow users to sign-up and book selected events. The website was made so that it was secure and avoided potential exploits. For example, a user signing up would have their password being hashed before being saved to the database.

It was created using HTML, Java and CSS for the front end development. The bootstrap framework was also used to assist with the design and aesthetic of the website. 
For the back end development PHP and SQL was used.

The website features:
- A homepage with a navigation bar to different pages
- Login page
- Sign-Up page
- Booking system
- Like system
- Database for storing user credentials and event details
